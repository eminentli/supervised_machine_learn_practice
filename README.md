# Supervised machine learning practice

The background is about a bank whose management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers. And a campaign the bank ran for liability customers last year showed a conversion rate of more than 9%. 

As a data scientist at the bank, it is imperative to build a model that helps the marketing department identify potential customers who are more likely to purchase a loan so that targeted marketing can be conducted to increase loan applications.
